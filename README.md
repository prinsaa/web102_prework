## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The biggest challenge was printing the individual contributions which wasn't working due to JS indexing issues from the previous challenge. 
The games were printed as expected, but an index error still presisted, unabling the program to continue further. 
I was able to overcome this challenge by analyzing the code more closely (and paying attention to the details) by using Inspect/Elements/Console.

It also took me some time to get used and understand the provided code.
